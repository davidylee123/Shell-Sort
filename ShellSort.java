/*
Initial Array: [36, 18, 10, 27, 3, 20, 9, 8]

First Increment (gap = 7):

The array is virtually divided into sublists of gap 7.
The sublists are: [36, 8], with all other elements not having pairs 7 positions apart.
After sorting the sublist [36, 8], the array becomes: [8, 18, 10, 27, 3, 20, 9, 36].
Second Increment (gap = 3):

The array is now divided into sublists of gap 3.
The sublists are: [8, 27, 9], [18, 3, 36], [10, 20].
After sorting each sublist, the array becomes: [3, 8, 10, 9, 18, 20, 27, 36].
Third Increment (gap = 1):

With a gap of 1, a regular insertion sort is applied to the entire array.
The array becomes: [3, 8, 9, 10, 18, 20, 27, 36].
Final Output: [3, 8, 9, 10, 18, 20, 27, 36]
